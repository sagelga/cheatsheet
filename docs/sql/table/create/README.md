# CREATE table
## Syntax
<<< @/code/Create/create-syntax.sql

You can find more information about [Data Types](/Overall/DataType/) and [Constraints](/Overall/Table/) in the following link.

::: tip
Create a table without determining a primary key is not a good idea.
:::

## Example
### Example One
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|id|INT(10)|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|salary|INT(10)|

and the result will come out like this

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-one.sql

::: tip Note
Margining the datatypes or constraints is not required by SQL compiler, but we do it for cleaner reading.
:::

## Create `PRIMARY KEY` constraints
### Example One
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types.<br>
This time, we choose `id` attribute as the table Primary Key.

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check:|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|salary|INT(10)|

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-pk-one.sql

::: tip Note
Table constraint name is not required to be in format. You will have to remember it to delete that constraint.
:::

### Example Two
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types.<br>
This time, we choose `id` **and** `first_name` attribute as the table Primary Key (As a Composite Primary Key)

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check:|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)|:ballot_box_with_check:|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|salary|INT(10)|

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-pk-two.sql

## Adding `FOREIGN KEY` constraints
Similar to Primary Key, but we have to point the Foreign Key to another table attribute.

### Example One
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types.

This time, `workplace_id` attribute is created to let employees know that which `Workplace` are they in by connecting it to `id` attribute (`Workplace` mandatory one---optional many `Employees`)<br>
But they requires another key (`id`) to identify each employee. Which generates composite key.

So this is how `Employees` table are designed.

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|workplace_id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check: with `id`||||:ballot_box_with_check:|Expense(salary)|
|id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check: with `workplace_id`|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|salary|INT(10)|

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-fk-one.sql

## Foreign Key additional constraints
Foreign key might be delete easily, so you can put options on what to do when the record in other table is gone or update

::: warning
You can choose **only one** option for each one. Choose wisely.
:::

### ON DELETE
When other table record is gone, what do the record in this table do?

|Option|Syntax|Benefit|
|-|-|-|
|No action|`ON DELETE`|Will not allow deletion on parent table|
|Cascade|`ON DELETE CASCADE`|Will delete the row to the same value as parent|
|Null|`ON DELETE SET NULL`|Will use null value instead|
|Default|`ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`|Will use default value instead|

By adding these constraints, the row will safely delete (able to delete normally). If not, the **reference integrity will blocked you** from deleting the row.

### ON UPDATE
When other table record get updated, what do the record in this table do?

|Option|Syntax|Benefit|
|-|-|-|
|No action|`ON UPDATE`|Will not allow update on parent table|
|Cascade|`ON UPDATE CASCADE`|Will update the row to the same value as parent|
|Null|`ON DELETE SET NULL`|Will use null value instead|
|Default|`ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`|Will use default value instead|

by adding these constraints, the row will delete safely (able to delete normally). If not, the reference integrity will blocked you from deleting the row.

## Adding `NOT NULL` constraints
### Example One
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types.<br>
This time, we choose `id` attribute as the table Primary Key.

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check:|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)||||:ballot_box_with_check:|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)||||:ballot_box_with_check:|
|salary|INT(10)|

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-notnull.sql

## Adding `UNIQUE` constraints
Adding a unique constraint will force new entries to have different unique value. Primary key is unique as a default.

### Example One
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types.<br>
We choose `id` attribute as the table Primary Key.<br>
and let the `first_name` attribute to be unique.

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check:|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)|||:ballot_box_with_check:|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)|
|salary|INT(10)|

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-unique-one.sql

### Example Two
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types.<br>
We choose `id` attribute as the table Primary Key.<br>
and let the `first_name` **and** `last_name` attribute to be unique (as composite unique constraint).

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check:|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)|||:ballot_box_with_check: with `last_name`|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)|||:ballot_box_with_check: with `first_name`|
|salary|INT(10)|

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-unique-two.sql

### Example Three
Create a table `Employees` with following columns and data types.<br>
We choose `id` attribute as the table Primary Key.<br>
and let the `first_name`, `last_name` attribute to be **individually** unique.

| Name | Data Type | PK | AI | UQ | NN | FK | Ref. FK |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|id|INT(10)|:ballot_box_with_check:|
|first_name|VARCHAR(255)|||:ballot_box_with_check:|
|last_name|VARCHAR(255)|||:ballot_box_with_check:|
|salary|INT(10)|

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-unique-three.sql

::: danger
Composite unique and 2 individual unique are not the same.<br>
Composite unique requires `first_name` **and** `last_name` to be the same to reject the input. As shown in comparison below.

|Input<br>(as `first_name` and `last_name`)|2 Individual Unique Constraint|Composite Unique Constraint|
|-|-|-|
|**Sam** Smith, **Sam** Mercury, Jeff Sam|:x:|:o:|
|**Sam Smith**, **Sam Smith**, Sam Sam|:x:|:x:|
|Jeff **Smith**, Sam Mercury, Tom **Smith**|:x:|:o:|
:::

## Create new table another table
You can use the queries to create new table by using `as` to join the query together.

### Example One
Create a new table `NewEmployees` from the query of `Employees` table.

<<< @/code/Where/where-between-employee.sql

and the code will go as following

<<< @/code/Create/create-example-subquery.sql

::: tip
As you can see, there is no need to set up the constraits. Some constraints are also copied from the reference table
